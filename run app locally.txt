How to run this project on localhost

    First thing you need to do is setup localhost server and for that you need NodeJS installed before.
    If you have installed NodeJS, you will need to install npm http-server. For more info you can go on https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
    Installation is very simple, in your gitbash console enter npm install http-server -g command and wait for completion
    After you install local server enter this command http-server C:/my_path_to_folder_app -p 8080 -a localhost and you will run localhost server on the port 8080. Then you can go in browser and type http://localhost:8080/ and you will get your app live
    Last step is go to facebook app settings (https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and change site URL to http://localhost:8080/
